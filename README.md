*This is version 1 of the web application*

## About the Web app. 

With this web application I aim to provide a free open source method for people to visualize and understand various technical indicators. 
People can use this application to select various technical indicators and then visualize and interact with them. This can help new financial engineers get a better understanding of how various parameters of a technical indicator will affect the way we execute trades. It uses the technical analysis library available for python and Plotly's interactive visualization tools to provide the user with a dynamically changing and interactive tool. 

Since this is just version 1 of the application I am yet to fix a lot of bugs and improve on it. So do bear with some of the little nuances. In case you would like to send any suggestions please email me at [sashanksurya9wj@gmail.com](sashanksurya9wj@gmail.com).
